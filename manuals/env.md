 title:  Set Up Environment 
---

To compile the emulator, we need to set up the proper development environment. 
We use Ubuntu 24.04 as the operating system, and use conda to manage the 
python environment. Please follow 
[this manual](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-emulator/tree/development/VM_images/conda-env)
to set up the conda environment.
